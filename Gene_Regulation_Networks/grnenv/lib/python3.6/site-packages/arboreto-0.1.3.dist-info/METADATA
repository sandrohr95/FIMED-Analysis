Inferring a gene regulatory network (GRN) from gene expression data is a computationally expensive task, exacerbated by increasing data sizes due to advances
in high-throughput gene profiling technology.

The arboreto_ software library addresses this issue by providing a computational strategy that allows executing the class of GRN inference algorithms
exemplified by GENIE3_ [1] on hardware ranging from a single computer to a multi-node compute cluster. This class of GRN inference algorithms is defined by
a series of steps, one for each target gene in the dataset, where the most important candidates from a set of regulators are determined from a regression
model to predict a target gene's expression profile.

Members of the above class of GRN inference algorithms are attractive from a computational point of view because they are parallelizable by nature. In arboreto,
we specify the parallelizable computation as a dask_ graph [2], a data structure that represents the task schedule of a computation. A dask scheduler assigns the
tasks in a dask graph to the available computational resources. Arboreto uses the `dask distributed`_ scheduler to
spread out the computational tasks over multiple processes running on one or multiple machines.

Arboreto currently supports 2 GRN inference algorithms:

1. **GRNBoost2**: a novel and fast GRN inference algorithm using `Stochastic Gradient Boosting Machine`_ (SGBM) [3] regression with `early-stopping`_ regularization.
2. **GENIE3**: the classic GRN inference algorithm using `Random Forest`_ (RF) or ExtraTrees_ (ET) regression.
